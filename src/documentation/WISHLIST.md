## WISH LIST
This list is comprised of my own ideas and some I have heard from the DBD community.
* Allow users to select what perks they have so we can limit the results to that set.
* Allow users to select which survivors/killers they have so we can limit the results to that set.
* Allow login so we can save which survivor/killers/perks a user has.
* Add item with add-ons to random build for survivor.
* Add add-ons to random build for killer.
* Add offerings to random build for killer and survivor.
* Add a reset password option. Will likely require getting a recovery email or phone number.
* Add a change password option. Might need this at launch of login. The manual way is to ask me to change it or create a new account. Not ideal in any way.
* The killer images are not the same format as the survivor images. They have a lot of padding to the right in the image. Get better killer images.
* Add an admin screen for adding new survivors.
* Add an admin screen for adding new killers.
* Move the image assets to S3. They are actually already there, I just need to update to use it.
* Replace console.log statements with a better logger. This app is probably too small to worry about logstash. What is a good solution? Need to research.
* Add monitoring to know which components are being loaded the most and how long are they taking? Really there is so much monitoring that can be added. None of it necessary at this time.
*
